Cloud computing is a significant help for organizations in running and managing databases. Many multinational companies have begun to adopt the cloud as a solution to manage workloads. The cloud is more feasible for organizations than the On-premise data centers. The cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP enhance the agility and flexibility to provide more ease in data management. Cloud platforms are the best choice as they assure to run and manage the data seamlessly and transfer files between the applications. As per stats, in 2021, the global public cloud services market is expected to grow by approximately 18 percent, which amounts to 304 billion U.S. dollars. A few cloud providers are now capable of autoscale, which allows you to provision more services. Advantages of Cloud Migration Faster Deployment Times Enhanced Security Features Less Infrastructure Complexity Built-in Status Monitoring Improved Cost Management Types of Cloud Computing IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) IaaS offers the necessary infrastructure to organizations based on pay-as-you-go instead of traditional data centers. However, as we discussed, the migration of infrastructure should happen since the current generation is dealing with the cloud. Specifically, infrastructure migration services include: Data Center Migration Physical-to-Physical(P2P) Physical-to-Virtual(P2V) Virtual-to-Virtual Virtual-to-Physical (V2P) PaaS (Platform as a Service) PaaS enables organizations to eliminate the often costly and complicated process of managing and purchasing software licenses. Essentially, the service providers manage everything related to the lifecycle of the application and allow developers to focus on application development. PaaS(Platform as a Service) is recommended for organizations that want to organize the workflows in a production environment that involves multiple developers. SaaS (Software as a Service) In the SaaS model, providers host productivity software like email, collaboration, and calendaring on their servers and lease it to organizations with a subscription fee. Companies can also use these for other business applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), document management, and customer relationship management (CRM). Conclusion Cloud migration is a better solution for an organization that focuses on continuous scalability and feasibility that reduces the risk and enables ease while doing business.

The backend handles server, application, and the database, the three significant aspects of any project. If you consider a registration form, the front end involves UI elements that allow you to provide the relevant data in the fields. (Image Source- https://blog.back4app.com/baas-vs-serverless/) The information provided through the application is stored in the database, which is responsible for data processing. The server located in a different location retracts the data from the database. The interconnectivity between these three essential elements ensures the proper functionality of an application. Why Should Developers Focus on Backend? Various Environments Organizations prefer to deploy the websites and applications in various environments as per their requirements. Cloud deployment, web server hosting, and seamless operations are essential aspects for companies. The varied hosting environments enable developers to use backend customization for their websites. Information Exchange Backend holds the complete responsibility of information exchange. Any user providing or accessing data from the application required hiccup-free backend functionality. The information submitted by the user will be stored using backend code. Hence backend coding plays a crucial role in information exchange in the business. Utilization of Every Frontend Functionality The user experience of any website will depict the image of the company. The quality of the backend code is one of the significant reasons that ensure website functionalities work flawlessly. The backend code is also responsible, which makes websites vulnerable to security attacks. Role of Serverless Backend (BaaS Vs Serverless Computing) (BaaS)Backend as a service is a cloud service model that allows developers to concentrate on writing the frontend application code. Using APIs and SDKs, developers can integrate all the backend functionalities without building the backend. BaaS vendors offer predefined software for actions implemented on servers, such as user authentication, database management, remote updating, push notifications, and cloud storage and hosting. Serverless computing and BaaS are similar in terms of serverless performance but have significant operational differences. From construction to code execution, here are differences between true serverless architecture. Serverless applications are broken down into functions and perform the actions only after each function responds to events. In the Baas, server-side functionalities are constructed and provided to the developers. Serverless architecture runs only when each function is triggered by an individual event. These serverless functions are robust and can run from anywhere as long as the application is communicating. The BaaS approach is not event-driven, as they require more server resources, and running code is dependent on the provider.

Recent reports suggest, “By 2021, spending on Cloud is expected to hit $530 Billion,” and migration services into the cloud would grow at an estimation of 23.9% CAGR. Currently, the Government agencies and enterprises are running the applications on the cloud to optimize costs, scaling up businesses, and bringing faster innovation. Image Source: ( https://www.i2k2.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5-Step-Roadmap-to-Migrate-Your-Applications-to-Cloud-Services-i2k2-Blog.jpg ) Overview Migrations occur for many reasons, including, but not limited to, data center closures, disaster recovery, server hardware/Operating System upgrades on a cloud network. Major cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and Google are providing the offerings out of the box for rapid data and application migration. Companies might have invested thousands of dollars in their existing applications by solely relying on web-based applications, which have custom build to meet the business needs. Although migrations are inevitable and are well-planned, a weak and inadequate plan or execution of migration can cause significant delays in deliveries and may overrun the cost factor. Since every application or server migration is unique, a preferred method should be taken to execute a successful migration based on the type of application it requires. Basic steps involved in migration Essential steps involved in Application migration follows: Step 1 – Selecting the destination cloud: With the involvement of Load Balancers, Firewalls, Physical, and Cloud Servers from simple shared hosting to a complex environment, we must adequately architect the destination server before the start of migration. Specifically, the plan should consider the type of application and the particular business requirements that we are migrating. If we rushed or skipped this step, we could end up the application with a migration failover. Step 2 – Performing initial migration: When the migration has started, an initial environmental assessment needs to be taken to ensure the effectiveness of the process. In general, this process is a five-step procedure, as mentioned in the below figure, and the pre-work requires the attention of both infrastructure and application teams. Both teams will work together to obtain the application list involved in the migration with the associated servers and determine the application group that is to be migrated together. Then, the migration can be scheduled in a flawless manner. Step 3 – Perform an iterative Re-Test: Prior to going live, comprehensive testing is the most critical step. After performing things like configuring the destination server environment, assigning IP to an application, restoring the database, it’s time for testing. Usually, we recommend the modification of files on Windows or Mac. This simulates a go-live only for our local computer, and we are allowed to test the migrated applications before reaching the environment. Similarly, we can add a host line to our host’s file as: {ip_address}{host_name_1}{host_name_2}{host_name_3}…{host_name_n} For example, 68.183.80.29 or https://scriptbees.com Now, run the recently migrated application on the browser. If we are migrating a Drupal CMS, login as an Administrator, and perform the activities like processing an order, changing a Magento product attribute, and so on. Then, test all the features of the migrated application to ensure functional behavior. Performing the migration requires the application manager to follow the necessary steps involved in between. Step 4 – The Go-Live/Migration phenomenon: Once the documented errors end up with troubleshooting and resolving by proper fixtures, the event should be scheduled by informing all the parties. Schedule and Communicate Application Downtime – The team needs to identify a cutover window with the user community and application owners. A critical application would be migrated during an off-hour without impacting the shift changes. The IT team will communicate to the right parties through the appropriate channel for the migration window. Before sending the scheduled communication into the migration window, an organization needs to secure Go-Live resources to ensure the availability of necessary components during the process. Cutover Applications to a New Data Center – While performing the Application cutover, a mock migration phase will start to pay off. A team can utilize the tested migration playbook developed during the simulated migration phase by following the process. Also, during the migration process, another team needs to stop the running application on the old platform and start on the new platform after ensuring the completion of replication and validate the application using the test scripts. The team also can reroute the traffic to the new platform when there is a loss of communication after migration and can track the ongoing issues raised if any. Step 5 – Decommission/Closeout: Significant decommission of unnecessary legacy applications can lower the operating costs, including the License Fee, Specialized SMEs, and usage. However, old applications can store essential data for business needs; a smart decommission strategy can help an organization for a better ROI. Performing Decommission Process – This stage follows with the determined servers, the part of an application that should be decommissioned. Accordingly, for this phase, the team needs to follow the decommissioning steps for both physical and virtual servers. For this, actions include: To verify servers checklist to decommission Change control initiation to decommission all servers, and more. Closeout – The team will complete performance cost measures that include ensuring any new contracts are set and budgeted in the next Financial year by verifying the inventory updates and updating cost changes. Step 6 – Post-Migration Support: A qualified and dedicated team is to be set to ensure the full functionality of the entire process after a successful product/application deployment. Also, it is highly recommended that we need to wait for at least Ten business days once the propagation is verified and a new server, an application will be in production until we decommission the old server. Conclusively, if we deal with thorough planning, setting up the destination server, comprehensive migration testing prior to the Go-Live event, the migration occurs seamlessly. Conclusion Cloud transformation requires a structured approach than anticipated by any of the Business firms to reap the benefits like scalability, productivity, and cost optimization. The path is to be built by any of the organizations itself in a way providing the right accelerators or resources for Cloud migration if required. Our expert team of Scriptbees will always be available to perform the migration even if the application is developed by your organization, or it is going to be built by our team. By satisfying your collective requirements, the migration will be started by suggesting the suitable cloud environment that your organization deserves, whether it is small-scale or large-scale.

These are the fundamental theoretical questions in migration research, although there is a broader range of addressing the issues than these fundamentals. Organizations that have built businesses by investing on infrastructure over the past few years are now willing to move to the cloud to improve the bottom line by evolving digitally. The cloud provides flexibility to such organizations that innovate, develop, test, and deploy the ideas on the fly at a fraction of costs associated with the maintenance of heavy infrastructure. ( https://bellintegrator.com/image/mobile/catalog/products/Cloud-Migration-Services.jpg ) Overview Some concepts of migration infrastructure are covered with existing concepts like Migration Systems , Migration Industry , and Culture of Migration . Because migration infrastructure is a broad concept and can be applied meaningfully to diverse empirical contexts. Migration is always facilitated, conditioned/constrained, but in ways, it differs widely. Infrastructure Migrations and its types However, as we discussed the migration of infrastructure should happen since the current generation is dealing with Cloud. Specifically, infrastructure migration services include: Data Center Migration – A comprehensive process that systematically follows the deploying and transferring the existing data center environment into another operative environment. Physical-to-Physical (P2P) – Migrating applications/programs and data from one secondary storage device to any other. Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) – Process of migrating an Operating System (OS), application programs and data from the secondary storage devices into a Virtual Machine (VM). Virtual-to-Virtual – Migration of an Environment, Application, Service and so on from one to another Virtual Machine or from one to another Cloud. Virtual-to-Physical (V2P) – Migrating of an Operating System (OS), application programs, or data from a virtual machine or a partition to a computer’s main disk.

With the smart collaboration of business and technology heads, it helps to formulate and execute operational strategies in achieving desired outcomes by bringing the best in consulting and execution models. The achievement is done powered by knowledge, research, and other factors followed by. Reasons for migration Few reasons behind the migration are: Cost Factor – The underlying driver in making the move from the legacy on-premise enterprise data warehouse to the cloud matters a lot. Cost not only encompasses the direct cost of owning or licensing the data center equipment, but also the cost of third party services, maintenance, and management, training and policy. Some kind of these indirect costs can make up a significant proportion of expenses of running on-premise data centers. Performance Investment in everything to own our on-premise environment is inflexibility and is a long-term commitment, which hinders our organization from obtaining the latest technology. Financially, by combining the upfront Capex costs of buying equipment and depreciation costs as it ages adds up quickly. And on the flip side, cloud service infrastructure affords us the flexibility and the best industry. Security Many of us who have an on-premise data infrastructure are concerned about security since the reality is that it is hard to be more secure and in control than housing our own data center. Cloud service providers like AWS, GCP, and snowflake, understand that thousands of customers entrust their data security to them. So, cloud providers are required to meet high-security standards in the industry set by health, government, and financial institutions enabling certifications like SOC2, ISO27001, to be much easier to obtain when running on a computing infrastructure which is already certified. Essential steps to reduce Migration risk Requirements planning – Scalability should be included in the planning where the performance of the system should be defined. Cost estimation – Instead of choosing the cheapest solution, it’s better to plan for the future. Even though it costs a bit high, we can save the cost of another migration by choosing the right solution. Evaluation of Plans – Plans that are chosen must be evaluated with the right analysis of whether or not they match with reality. Basic steps on how to Migrate Define When – Choose a perfect where the migration needs to be started and ensure that there is a minimalistic load on the system. And also make a note that each system has its own time schedule. Define Where – Make sure that the environment/technology chosen will fit our requirements and make valid predictions about the future operations that we are going to perform and take into account the mistakes that brought us to the current migration. Define How – Depending on how large the system is, define how to implement the migration and the best should be determined on the basis of case by case. Pros Less initial investment – Compared to an application server costing thousands of dollars, it won’t cost much when it comes to the cost of cloud and also the provisioning cost would be zero. Scalability – By choosing cloud-based solutions, we can scale up or down as our business grows or our budget tightens. Burst ability – When we need extra capacity for a short period, the cloud offers this feature where a dedicated server cannot. fIncreased storage capacity – Prices that are charged by the cloud for storage capacity is much lower than buying any physical hard drives. Available all the time – Since the cloud is not tied down to a single location, we need not worry in that case. A Cloud-based solution is obviously a good idea irrespective of the size of the organization. Cons Unexpected migration problems – The apps must be recorded to work in a virtualized environment and the data must be reformatted to get Sync with the SaaS formats. Although we feel that the initial costs regarding the cloud are less, future associated costs can bring the right backup. Uncontrollable risk – Cloud providers may have Sophisticated anti-malware tools because of in need of them. Hackers may attempt to hack into primary servers often. A private server is unlikely to be a target for hackers. So, maybe it’s better to risk a problem that can be fixed in-house than to risk which is out of our hands because. Conclusion Nowadays, the majority of organizations are in need of some services that are related to the cloud and its offerings. Migrating from Infrastructure to cloud is an achievement for the organizations that are upgrading to the cloud. Although the risk is a big deal at the beginning stage in the process of migration, the future risk is very less. Sharing is caring!

So what does ELK stand for? The term “ELK” is an acronym referring to three open-source projects. Elasticsearch , Logstash , and Kibana , where the terms can be explained in brief as follows. Elasticsearch is an open-source, free Java-based, RESTful search engine designed, built, licensed, and distributed by the Apache software foundation. It can also perform search and analysis functions by using a standard RESTful JSON file and APIs. Logstash is a data processing pipeline that runs at the server-side that simultaneously ingests the data from multiple sources, transforms the data, and sends it to a “stash,” like Elasticsearch. It also provides structure to data like parsing unstructured logs, and data transmitting to ElasticSearch. Kibana lets the users visualize the data in the form of charts and vivid graphs and dashboards present in Elasticsearch. It is said that Elasticsearch is the next-gen evolution of the ELK stack. ( https://burnhamforensics.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/elk-2.png?w=685 ) Evolution of ELK It all started with Elasticsearch The evolution of ELK has taken place from Elasticsearch, an open-source, RESTful, distributed, and JSON-based search engine. It is an easy to use, scalable, and flexible search engine. It also earned hyper-popularity among its users and a company formed around it, just for search. Then, it grew with Logstash and Kibana Users have started using Elasticsearch for logs and wanted to easily ingest and visualize them. Enter Kibana, the flexible visualization tool, and Logstash, the powerful ingest pipeline. Eventually, the community expanded with numerous use cases Whether it is to find the top N results in a text-based documents jungle, freely slice and dice metrics, analyze security events, or the worldwide community keeps pushing the boundaries with ELK. Then, the journey has dropped a Beat on ELK When one of the users said, “I want to tail a file,” and the company listened to it. In 2015, the company had introduced a family of single-purpose, lightweight data shippers into the ELK Stack equation, and they called them Beats. So, where did it leave ELK? It seems to be funny. Do we need to call it BELK? ELKB? Or BLEK? This is the primary question raised by many ones. The acronym alphabet soupification threat was real. The acronym really wasn’t for a stack so scalable. Finally, enter the Elastic Stack The similar open-source products users know and love, only better integrated, more comfortable to get started with, more powerful, and brimming with possibility. As an end and as of now, the journey flow has entered into the Elastic Stack finally. Why use ELK Stack? In this data-driven world, databases must consistently handle the increasingly vast amounts of data. Typically, analytic processes are becoming a slow down as the amount of data a system handles continues to increase. ELK stack helps us to improve these analytic processes. Few of the overview of the benefits of using ELK stack includes, ELK stack is a total log-analysis platform for analyses, search, and visualization of log-generated data from different platforms/machines It can be pulled, analyzed, and visualized data securely, in real-time, from any source and format. The ELK stack can perform centralized logging that helps to identify any server and application-related issues across multiple servers and correlate the logs in a specific time frame. It is geared to handle big data to provide essential business insights It is simple to use, set up, and also user-friendly Elk is highly cost-effective as an open-source program. Case Studies Some of the case studies on the usage of the ElK stack have been mentioned below. NetFlix Netflix extensively depends on the ELK stack. The company uses the ELK stack to monitor and analyze the security log of customer service operations. It allows them to store, index, and search documents from more than fifteen clusters comprising almost 800 nodes. LinkedIn The most popular and trusted social media marketing site, LinkedIn uses the ELK stack to monitor security and performance. The IT team has integrated ELK with Kafka to support its load in real-time. Their ELK operation includes more than 100 clusters across six different data centers. Reasons to use the ELK (Elastic) Stack Elastic Stack all the time meets the growing business needs with an integrated and efficient toolset designed to deliver actionable real-time insights from vast sets of search data. Its years of practical implementations and highly active community offer an unmatched combination of maturity and future-proof growth. There are many scores of reasons to consider the Elastic Stack, and a few of them are listed below. Enterprise Search By empowering users to search anything from anywhere, Elastic Stack can unify the content platforms into a relevant and highly personalized experience. By doing so at the search level, Elastic Stack can empower users to search across the data silos, and enterprise systems, by offering them a comprehensive yet highly personalized search experience. Observability Elastic Stack brings real-time logs, metrics, and APM traces into a single consulted view easily. Companies can locate opportunities as they arise and challenges as they begin to develop, enabling for a profitable and quick response. Scalability The ELK stack deploys at scale irrespective of the company’s technical infrastructure. Private and public cloud implementations, containerized or a bare-metal, and SaaS solution, the Elastic Stack is built to work with any company systems and adapt as the company grows. Security As a part of the platform’s internal security, including field-level security on documents and index encryption, the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) application collects all the security information across the enterprise. It provides richly detailed dashboards that allow for close scrutiny of security operations. Conclusion If we want to justify the question, “Why do we use ELK Stack?” It is a successive modern platform. We can also use it as a Stack, including its easy-to-learn log-analysis function, Globally. Even though the ELK stack suits well to handle big data for large corporations, it is still a valuable suite for startup companies running their smaller systems. ScriptBees offer a tailored approach across every development phase of the ELK Stack by providing you the services that you require at a less cost compared to the current market. Sharing is caring!

Alerting Overview Alerting with Prometheus is further separated into two parts. The alerting rules of Prometheus servers send alerts to the Alertmanager. Then, the alert manager manages these alerts, including silencing, aggregation, inhibition, and sends out the notifications through methods like email, on-call notifying systems, and chat platforms. The primary steps involved in setting up notifications and alerts are given below. Setup, configure the Alertmanager Configure Prometheus to communicate with the Alertmanager Write alerting rules in Prometheus Source:-( https://www.aliptic.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grafana-prometheus.png ) Alertmanager Alertmanager is meant to handle the alerts that are sent by the client applications like the Prometheus server. The Alertmanager takes care of grouping, deduplicating, and routing such alerts to the exact receiver integration, including an email, OpsGenie, or PaperDuty. The core concepts implemented by the Alertmanager are given below. Grouping Grouping categorizes similar forms of alerts into a single notification. Especially, this is useful at the time of larger outages at the time when more systems failed at once, and simultaneously hundreds to thousands of alerts may be firing. For example, the Fifties or Hundreds of service instances are running on our cluster when a network partition takes place. And, about half of the service instances can no longer reach the database. The alerting rules of Prometheus are configured to send an alert for every service instance if it cannot communicate with database. Resultantly, hundreds of such alerts are sent to the Alertmanager. Being a user, one wants to get one single page even though still being able to notice which service instances are exactly affected. Therefore the user can configure the Alertmanager to group alerts based on the respective clusters and alert name so that it sends only a single compact notification. Timing for grouped notifications, grouping the alerts, and the receivers of such notifications are configured with a routing tree in the configuration file created. Inhibition This is a concept of suppressing the notifications for certain alerts if other certain alerts are firing already. For example, when an alert is firing that informs an entire cluster is not reachable. The Alertmanager may be configured to mute all the other alerts concerning the same cluster if that specific alert is firing. This prevents the notifications for firing hundreds or thousands of alerts, which falls unrelated to the actual issue. Inhibitions can be configured via Alertmanager’s configuration file. Silences These are such a straightforward way to mute particular alerts for a specified time period. Silencers are configured based on the matchers, which are like the routing tree. The total incoming alerts are cross-checked to see whether they match to all the regular expressions or equality matchers of active silence. If they do so, none of the notifications will be sent out for that alert. Silencers are configured in the web interface of Alertmanager. Client behavior Since Alertmanager has special requirements for the behavior of its client, those are relevant only for the advanced use cases, whereas the Prometheus is not used to send alerts. High Availability Alertmanager allows configuration to create a cluster for high availability. This can be configured by using “cluster-*” flags. It’s essential not to load balance traffic between Prometheus and its Alerts Managers. But, instead, point Prometheus to all the Alertmanagers list. Sending Alerts to Clients via Slack Let us take an example of sending alerts to the client by creating a notification template on it. Let us look at it in brief. Note: Prometheus automatically manages the sending of alerts generated by its configured alerting rules. It is highly recommended that Prometheus’ alerting rules be configured on the basis of time-series data rather than the implementation of a direct client. The Alertmanager has two APIs as v1, v2, both for alert listening. The v1 scheme is written in the code snippet below. At the same time, the v2 scheme is specified as an OpenAPI specification, which is found in the Alertmanager repository. Clients are expected to re-send the alerts on a continual basis as long as they are still active (in order from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, in general). Clients can push the alerts list to Alertmanager through a POST request. Each alert label is used to identify the identical instances of an alert and to perform deduplication. Always, the annotations are set to those received most recently and for the one which is not identifying an alert. Both the timestamps, startsAt , and endsAt are the optional ones. The Alertmanager assigns the current time if startsAt is omitted. Whereas, endsAt is the only set if the alert’s end time is known. Or else, it will be set to a configurable timeout period from the time since the alert was received last. The generatorURL is one of the unique back-link fields that identify the causing entity of this client alert. The simple coding structure of the v1 scheme for the version, 0.21 mentioned above are represented in the below snippet. [ { “labels”: { “alertname”: “<requiredAlertName>”, “<labelname>”: “<labelvalue>”, … }, “annotations”: { “<labelname>”: “<labelvalue>”, }, “startsAt”: “<rfc3339>”, “endsAt”: “<rfc3339>”, “generatorURL”: “<generator_url>” }, …] Integration Alertmanager can be integrated with tools like Grafana, Jenkins, and lots more. Let us have a look at how to integrate Alertmanager with Grafana. Grafana Integration Iris can be integrated easily into an existing Grafana implementation. Iris Configuration Enable the builtin available Grafana webhook in the Iris configuration. It can be represented in the below snippet. webhooks: – grafana Now create an application using the UI. Let us use the name ‘grafana’ in this example. Once we have completed creating the application, we’ll be able to retrieve the application’s key. And here, we will use “abc” as the application key. Grafana Configuration Grafana can be helpful for us to configure Iris as a notification channel, using the application, the application’s key, and the target plan as parameters in the webhook URL. The configuration of the webhook URL is given below. Name: iris-team1Type: webhookUrl: http://iris:16649/v0/webhooks/grafana?application=grafana&key=abc&plan=team1Http Method: POST This simple configuration adds the notification channel to our alert in the Grafana. Conclusion As explained by the Alertmanager with Prometheus, it can also be integrated with other tools like Grafana, Jenkins, IRIS API, and lots more. At ScriptBees, we’ll take care of these integrations and deliver you the right build based on your requirements. Our technical expert team will also suggest the right choice on selecting the specific integrations and configuration files as well. Sharing is caring!

Let us discuss some critical concepts on Azure DevOps that affects the most. Introduction We can assert that Azure DevOps falls under the evolution of VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services), and all we require is to assemble our product from the initial development stage till the end. Azure DevOps is a unified platform that helps every individual software developer worldwide design the projects utilizing the Agile process, oversee code utilizing Git, test the application, and deploy the code using CI/CD framework. We would be well known as Dev+Ops = DevOps , meant as a combination of Development and Operation Processes for Software Development. Why should we consider Azure DevOps? Emerging and leveraging variant features, Azure DevOps has considered a big priority. Azure is also ever-widening cloud computing services set that help the companies in meeting Business challenges. The Azure cloud offers the freedom to build, develop, manage, and deploy the applications globally using preferred tools and frameworks. More scattered aspects of considering Azure DevOps include: Azure is Secure The proactive approach of Azure concerning security, compliance, and privacy is unique. Microsoft, however, leading the industry in establishing and meeting clear security and privacy requirements consistently. Competing as compliance of industry-leading and privacy certifications to built-in security controls and unique threat intelligence, the Azure cloud consists of everything that we necessitate to identify and protect against the evolving threats that occurred rapidly. Azure is Global With its vast chain of datacentres across many regions other than any cloud provider, Azure provides global reach with a local presence that every Business firm needs, allowing the users to reduce the factors including cost, time, and complexities while operating the global infrastructure by meeting the local data residency needs. Azure is the Future The advent of new cloud and smarter technologies are revealing new scenarios that are not possible until now. Smart sensors and IoT devices are allowing us to capture new and raw data from industrial equipment far-ranging from factories to farms and smart cities to our own living homes. Every newer smart device – whether it is a Car or just a ceiling fan, is increasingly connecting to the cloud by default. Perhaps the hybrid cloud is unfolding its growth – integrating on-premise datacentres to the cloud and accessing the world’s most remote destinations. Building a bridge on these two new and distinct realities – adding artificial intelligence as an ingredient to run across all systems, we have entered into the current era of Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge. Where an Intelligent Edge is the expansion of the set of connected devices that assemble and analyze data closure to our eyes, the Azure cloud platform has built to provide an agile and secured experience across the intelligent cloud or intelligent edge enduring the principles such as Consistent Application Development, Unified Identity, Artificial Intelligence across every device , and many more. Primary reasons to use Azure DevOps There have been various primary reasons for Azure DevOps, depending on its usage, benefits, and more since it was announced (Sep 10, 2019) until now, and you may be wondering about literally – ‘ Why?’ Let me clear this for you! Originally, Azure DevOps is a Source Code Management Tool where the teams share their code and work collectively. 5 primary reasons to consider Azure DevOps for your organization can be given as: Collaboration As sharing is the Heart of Azure DevOps, and being able to host and manage your entire code snippet centrally is vital to every organization for optimal significant optimization. Although the code is a collection of PowerShell, VB Script that you use to manage servers, storing the same in Azure DevOps provides a central location for code management. Code versioning is also an essential dimension for code management, whether you desired to use Team Foundation Version Control or Git. Work Items If you don’t have any code even, you can manage and coordinate your Work Items systems. Work “Items” are represented as a Server, System Bug, a Risk that is up to you, but it empowers when you create them as a process template. Using such a template, you can mold your work items as an Agile Framework or a CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) model for your Administration’s smooth working. So, your entire team can divide the complex systems under some manageable workloads. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery For every organization, which is a Software-driven, Azure cloud provides a robust platform where one can deploy your solutions in a pipeline allowing for CI/CD. Either you are pushing a solution – hosted in Azure or AWS, the Azure CI/CD pipeline takes care of your solution from the development to deployment stage with its extensive marketplace for plugins and integrations. Open Platform With the extensive integration provided by Azure DevOps, including industry and community tools, it is far from a closed-off single vendor solution – an early version of TFS. Since there is a marketplace for hundreds of available extensions, even Azure DevOps does not do something out of the box; the odds tool exists in the market, which does. With this openness, Microsoft has stood as a leader in promoting cooperation compared to its competitors, evident in the marketplace where you can find the integration extensions from AWS & lack to ServiceNow. Become a Software Company One of the ideas presented by Satya Nadella, CEO – Microsoft, “Every firm required to be a Software company,” and there has been a rise to a newer business operating model type, which can be given as COM (Cloud Operating Model). This model seeks to bring Business Leaders, Technology Managers, and Teams to specify how technology is implemented. Conclusion To sum it up, a successful company’s measure deals with how far it is harnessing the technology and how offensive and defensive the strategy is. Building a COM (Cloud Operating Model) and making it a backbone of IT infrastructure will route every business on the right path. This could be achieved by including Azure DevOps services on your cloud projects built irrespective of the domain. Our ScriptBees team develops the desired Azure DevOps applications that you are required within the respective timelines, followed by accurate deployments. Sharing is caring!

    "text": "What is TICK Stack, and why should we consider using it? – ScriptBees Home Company About Us Process Manual Careers Industries Services AI Services Cloud Consulting​ Data Engineering​ Enterprise Application Staff Augmentation RPA Services ERP Solutions Infrastructure Automation Technologies Contact Us Home Company About Us Process Manual Careers Industries Services AI Services Cloud Consulting​ Data Engineering​ Enterprise Application Staff Augmentation RPA Services ERP Solutions Infrastructure Automation Technologies Contact Us 0 Comments TICK Stack If you observe the word TICK, you might get a doubt as to why the word is capitalised. Yes, it is an abbreviation. So, we all know that every abbreviated word is done only if we can elaborate it with its respective letters. Likewise, the term TICK comprises four technologies associated with it. To define TICK Stack, it is a collection of associated technologies combined to deliver a platform for storing, capturing, monitoring, and visualising the time series data. The technologies that comprise TICK are listed below. Telgeraf – A collection of sequential tie data from a range of sources, including IoT devices. InfluxDB – An efficient and high-performance database store for handling high volumes of time-series data. Chronograf – A real-time visualisation of InfluxDB data. Kapacitor – Monitoring and alerting based on the views of InfluxDB data and anomalies that contain within those views. While considering the aspect of collecting data, unlike Prometheus, which is a pull model, the TICK Stack is the push model. InfluxDB component is the best time series of the databases, which is the heart of TICK Stack. TICK Stack is backed by InfluxData, and it requires an enterprise version for some features like DB Clustering. But, fairly, it is a good choice for monitoring. Many companies are using TICK Stack in a few production places, and they had a good experience with it. The basic Feature set of TICK Telegraf It is a plugin-driven server agent for metrics collection and reporting. Telegraf plugins source various metrics directly from the systems it runs on, metric pulling from the third-party APIs, or to listen for metrics even via a Kafka and StatsD consumer service. It also contains the output plugins to send metrics to a variety of other datastores, message queues, and services, including Graphite, InfluxDB, Datadog, OpenTSDB, Librato, Kafka, NSQ, MQTT, and many others. InfluxDB InfluxDB is a time-series database built from the ground level for handling high write and query loads. InfluxDB is a customized high-performance datastore written for time-stamped data specifically, and especially helpful for use cases such as DevOps and IoT monitoring, and also real-time analytics. Maintain space on your machine by configuring InfluxDB to store data for a defined period of time, and to expire and delete unwanted data from the system automatically. Also, InfluxDB offers a SQL-like query language for data interacting. Chronograf Chronograf is the visualization engine and administrative user interface of the stack. It is quick and simple to set up and maintain the alerting and monitoring of our infrastructure. Using chronograf is quite simple and includes templates and libraries that allow us to build dashboards rapidly with real-time visualizations of the data and to easily create automation and alerting rules. Kapacitor Kapacitor is a native data processing engine, and it is capable of processing both stream and batch data from InfluxDB. Kapacitor lets us plug in our own custom logic or user-defined functions to process alerts with dynamic thresholds, compute statistical anomalies, match metrics for patterns, and perform specific actions depending on these alerts, such as dynamic load rebalancing. Kapacitor integrates with OpsGenie, HipChat, Alerta, Sensu, Slack, PagerDuty, and more applications. Who can use TICK Stack? TICK Stack is a helpful technology stack for: Admins TICK Stack is a useful tool for the system administrators because it aggregates the multiple host information in one place by making it possible for the flexible dependency visualization and selection. The notifications of TICK Stack saves the administrators time and helps them to respond only to the highly relevant ones. Developers A huge plugin count like MS SQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Elastic Search, and more can help the developers to keep track of their narrow areas in the software product usage and can increase the efficiency of work. Customers This tool helps the customers to identify the low efficiencies of individual sections of the infrastructure, load prediction, and optimize the server expansion strategies. Resultantly, the customer can be aware of how the services are used efficiently and tailoring them on their needs accordingly. Why should one use TICK Stack? When you feel the alternatives are so expensive, have bad clients, lack of features, you need control over managing the data, or just simply interested in a promising tool for the time-series data, one can use the TICK Stack. Reasons behind to use TICK Stack for monitoring Open-Source and Cheap The only cost that you should bear is the hardware that you run it on InfluxDB’s hardware sizing guideline and the time that we put in setting up. Works with the StatsD clients We simply need to switch the host your StatsD client points, if we’re using StatsD. Soup-to-nuts monitoring We can collect, store, visualize, and alert on our data with a stack designed to work together. We don’t need to struggle with integrating services built by separate teams. Time-series data, not just metrics TICK Stack is made for time-series data, which includes the metrics, but isn’t limited to it. Many of the users faced various types of time-series data the past few years working with the Big Data space (monitoring, analytics, sensors, anomaly detection, and other use cases of time-series data) and felt the tools are on lack of something. So hopefully, TICK testifies to be a useful tool in the toolbox. A simple TICK Stack and server connections are represented in the below image. Telegraf integrates and pulls the stats from all service kinds Redis, Elasticsearch, StatsD, PostgreSQL, and much more. Telegraf makes light of the work in pulling the metrics from all our infrastructure into a single place. Chronograf’s design The design looks clean, nice, and is easy to use. Chronograf’s SQL-like query language No clicking via a bunch of long menus to set up our visualizations and queries. Kapacitor’s TICKscript We can write our alerts or any type of event in the declarative code. It’s pretty and powerful stuff. Kapacitor supports sending events to services like PagerDuty, Slack, webhooks, and more. Conclusion TICK Stack is the less cost-effective and an easy to implement monitoring service compared to the other ones. The TICK Stack can be implemented using multiple technologies or domains like Kubernetes, Prometheus, and with multiple Operating Systems like Windows, Ubuntu, and more. Ultimately, we can consider TICK Stack as a widely used monitoring tool in multiple aspects. Our company, ScriptBees, offers various services in terms of TICK Stack with a tailored procedure.

We can also say Elasticsearch is a database that allows us to store, search, and analyze complex data volumes faster in near real-time. On top of Lucene Standard Analyzer, Elasticsearch provides a distributed system for indexing and automatic type guessing utilizing a JSON based REST API (because Elasticsearch is developed in Java) referring to Lucene features. According to DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is a popular search engine followed by Apache Solr, which is also based on Lucene. Introduction As Elasticsearch hides complexity from beginners, it is also easy to set up out of the box since it ships with sensible defaults. With minimal efforts being invested in it, one can grasp the basics easily with its short learning curve and become productive shortly. It’s schema-less based, using some defaults for data indexing. Backend components of Elasticsearch Because it’s good to have a basic understanding of the main backend components, few of them are listed below. Noda Node is a single server, a part of a cluster that stores our data, participates in cluster’s indexing and search capabilities, and can be identified by name, same as a cluster. By default, it is a random Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) assigned at startup, which is editable. Cluster Holding our data together and providing federated indexing and search capabilities with more than one node collection is denoted as a cluster. There can be N nodes with the same cluster name. Elasticsearch operates in a distributed cross-cluster replication system, so a secondary cluster may serve as a hot backup. Index As a collection of documents with identical features, for suppose, we can have an index for a specific customer, one for product info identified by a unique name to retrieve when performing indexing search, update/delete operations. An index is similar to a database in RDBMS, where we can define as many indexes in a single cluster. Document A document is a basic information unit that can be indexed. For instance, you can have an index about a product and a corresponding document for each customer expressed in JSON format. Multiple documents can be shared for one single product. Shards and Replicas Shard is a subset of index documents where an index can be divided into many shards. A shard can host on any node in the cluster since it’s a fully-functional and independent index. What’s so Significant about Elasticsearch? ES is purely a document-oriented database designed to store, retrieve, and manage either document-oriented or semi-structured data. While using ES, we store the data in JSON format, and we query them for retrieval. Because ES uses Lucene Standard Analyzer for indexing automatic type guessing, every feature of ES is exposed as a REST API as: Index API used to document the index, Get API used to retrieve the document, Search API used to submit the query and get a result Put Mapping API used to override the default choices and define the mapping. We can nest any queries as we need because the real-world projects require different search conditions like weights, predefined field values, and so on. Such complexities can be expressed through a single DSL query, powerful and designed to handle real-world query complexity, which also uses the Lucene TermQuery to execute. How does ES work? Internally, ES works on “sharing nothing” architecture, where the primary ES data structure uses the inverted index managed using Lucene’s APIs. In simple terms, an inverted index is a mapping of each unique ‘word’ (token) to documents (locations) list containing that word, which makes it possible to locate documents with provided keywords quickly. Index information stored in one or multiple partitions called Shards and ES is able to distribute and allocate shards dynamically to the nodes in a cluster, and replicate them. This mechanism makes it flexible concerning the data distribution, and redundancy can be provided by distributing that replica shards (primary shard ‘copies’) to different cluster nodes. Indexing operations use primary shards, and search queries use both shard types. With multiple nodes and replicas increases query performance. ES use cases While ES can be used in various ways, one of the use cases is listed below because it is difficult to capture all. Cisco Commerce delivery platform Cisco upgraded its commercial platform to ES when it was introduced in 2017, switching from RDBMS for the reasons: RDBMS is not distributed and fault-tolerant. Type-ahead and Rank-based search for data sourced from multiple Databases on 30/40 attribute to get sub-second responses. Global Search – If no specific objects are specified in the search, the search engine will find results against multiple objects. Instant search on E-commerce platform across Retail Product Catalogues Many retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, and BigBasket use ES to index their product catalogs and inventory, alongside all the product attributes. So, when the buyer searches for a specific product attribute, the store can display the right products instantly, including features/specs. A near-instant search bar will up the revenue by delivering a better product catalog search experience for the user and make the search a primary navigation form. Walgreens and Kreeger are also the biggest retail companies streamlining their online grocery shopping experience with Elasticsearch. Compatibility ES has a rich set of client libraries for many programming languages like Java, JS, PHP, C#, Python, Go, and many more. By this, the user can integrate with ES quite easily. Benefits of using ES Fast-Time-to-Value ES offers simple REST APIs, which is an HTTP interface and uses schema-free JSON documents for quick building applications for a variety of use-cases. Near Real-Time operations Usually, ES operations like Reading/Writing data takes less than a second to complete. This lets us use ES for near Real-Time use-cases like anomaly detection and application monitoring. Complimentary Tools and Plugins ES comes integrated with Kibana, one of the popular visualization and reporting tool. In addition, ES offers integration with Beats and Logstash, enabling you to transform source data and load it to your ES cluster. Bottlenecks Few of ES’s bottlenecks include: ES doesn’t support multi-language in terms of handling request and response data (other than JSON), unlike in Apache Solr (also supports CSV, XML). ES is not good at data stores like MongoDB, Hadoop. Even if it worked fine for smaller use cases, streaming TerraBytes of data might occur in chokes or losses of data. Conclusion Being ES is a distributed, RESTful, and analytics search engine capable of solving a wide variety of problems, many companies are switching to ES and integrating with their current backend infrastructure since: Tools like Kibana and Logstash allow you to make sense of your data in such simple and quick ways by using charts and performing the granular searches. ES allows you to zoom out to your data using aggregation and make sense of billions of log lines. It combines different types of searches like structured, unstructured, geo, application search, security analytics, metrics, and logging. We, at ScriptBees, with our dedicated resource team, we’ll provide you with a well equipped and customized search engine built on Apache Lucene, meeting all the standard requirements proposed by the user/client. However, further support will also be provided for the scalability and necessary changes that are needed. Sharing is caring!

    "text": "TestNG – ScriptBees Home Company About Us Process Manual Careers Industries Services AI Services Cloud Consulting​ Data Engineering​ Enterprise Application Staff Augmentation RPA Services ERP Solutions Infrastructure Automation Technologies Contact Us Home Company About Us Process Manual Careers Industries Services AI Services Cloud Consulting​ Data Engineering​ Enterprise Application Staff Augmentation RPA Services ERP Solutions Infrastructure Automation Technologies Contact Us 0 Comments TestNG is an Automation Testing framework in which NG stands for “Next Generation”. TestNG is inspired from JUnit and NUnit which uses the annotations (@) – a special form of syntactic meta-data added to Java source code for better code readability, but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easy to use. Why use TestNG? Using TestNG framework, we can generate a proper report that can easily identify how many test cases are passed, failed and skipped as well. Then, we can execute the failed tests separately. For example suppose we have five test cases, one method is written for each test case and assume that program is written using main method without TestNG. When we run this program, three methods are executed successfully and the fourth method is failed. Then, we can run the fourth method separately by implementing certain changes on the code. It is not possible without using TestNG. Also, TestNG provides an option i.e., testing-failed.xml file in test-output folder where we can run only failed test cases by executing this file. Features of TestNG: Features supported by TestNG are: Annotations (@) – ‘ Annotations’ are a predominant feature of TestNG that are simply a piece of instruction for the compiler that we apply to classes, methods or variables in our Java code. Any class can be turned into a TestNG test class by just adding one TestNG annotations. @Test – is used to designate test methods in a class and can be applied to individual methods as, public class ExampleMethodAnnotations { @Test public void checkSomething() {} @Test public void checkSomethingElse() {} public void notATestMethod() {} } Test annotation can also be applied to a class, where all public methods of the class will be test methods, unless the methods are annotated by one of @BeforeXXX or @AfterXXX configuration annotations listed below. @Test public class ExampleClassAnnotation { public void checkSomething() {} public void checkSomethingElse() {} } Configuring Annotations Configuration Annotations can be applied to methods for performing some action before/after specific events: @BeforeSuite/@AfterSuite – Executes before/after any tests in test suite @BeforeTest/@AfterTest – Executes before/after any tests in element which contains this class @BeforeClass/@AfterClass – Executes before/after any tests in this class @BeforeMethod/@AfterMethod – Executes before/after every test method in this class @BeforeGroups/@AfterGroups – Executes before/after any tests in specified groups The TestBeforeAfter are executed in the below order public class TestBeforeAfter { @BeforeSuite public void beforeSuite() {} @AfterSuite public void afterSuite() {} @BeforeTest public void beforeTest() {} @AfterTest public void afterTest() {} @BeforeClass public void beforeClass() {} @AfterClass public void afterClass() {} @BeforeMethod public void beforeMethod() {} @AfterMethod public void afterMethod() {} @Test public void test1() {} @Test public void test2() {} } Supports data-driven testing – with the help of the annotation ‘@dataprovider’ Multi-Threading support – tests can run in multiple threads to speed up execution flow Powerful execution model – without using any TestSuite, execution can be done Test groups – test methods can associate with any number of groups Test Priorities – tests can be prioritized based on requirement Parameterized test methods and data providers – allows data to be supplied to a configuration method/test form any other method or from an XML file Parallel Execution – TestNG supports running tests in multiple threads. Using this feature, TestNG speeds up the execution of thread-safe tests. In default, all tests runs in a single thread. Usage of multiple threads can be done by using parallel and thread-out attributes. Setup Maven dependency Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool developed by Apache. We can add the Maven dependency in our pom.xml file as, <dependency> <groupId>org.testng</groupId> <artifactId>testng</artifactId> <version>6.11</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> The latest version of Maven repository is available here . TestNG plugin may be downloaded and installed from Eclipse Marketplace while using Eclipse. Assertions Asserts helps us to verify the test conditions and decide whether the test has passed or failed. A test is considered as successful ONLY if it is completed without throwing any exception. Assertions are further divided as: SoftAssert – helps to collect all assertions throughout @Test method. HardAssert – throws an exception immediately when assert statement fails and continues with the next test in the Test Suite. Including assertions in TestNG the test functionality can be controlled with JDK version form or above 1.7. Writing a Test Case We just need to annotate test method with org.testng.annotations.Test annotation to write a test. @Testpublic void givenNumber_whenEven_thenTrue() { assertTrue(number % 2 == 0); } Test Configurations When writing test cases, we often need to execute some configurations before test executions and also some clean-up features at method, class, suite, and group levels. @BeforeClass public void setup() { number = 12; } @AfterClass public void tearDown() { number = 0; } Test Execution Running test cases with Maven’s “test” command will execute all test cases annotated with @Test putting to a default test suite. <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.19.1</version> <configuration> <suiteXmlFiles> <suiteXmlFile> src\\test\\resources\\test_suite.xml </suiteXmlFile> </suiteXmlFiles> </configuration> </plugin> For multiple XML files covering all test cases, we can add all the files in suiteXmlFiles tag. <suiteXmlFiles> <suiteXmlFile> src/test/resources/parametrized_test.xml </suiteXmlFile> <suiteXmlFile> src/test/resources/registration_test.xml </suiteXmlFile> </suiteXmlFiles> To run the test standalone, we need to have TestNG library in classpath and compiled test class along with XML configuration file java org.testng.TestNG test_suite.xml Parameterized Tests Unlike other testing frameworks, TestNG allows to pass parameters to test methods. The snippet of code illustrates this idea: @DataProvider [1]private static final Object[][] getMoney() { return new Object[][] { {new Money(4, “USD”), new Money(3, “USD”), 7}, {new Money(1, “EUR”), new Money(4, “EUR”), 5}, {new Money(1234, “CHF”), new Money(234, “CHF”), 1468}}; } @Test(dataProvider = “getMoney”) [2] public void shouldAddSameCurrencies(Money a, Money b, int expectedResult) { Money result = a.add(b); assertEquals(result.getAmount(), expectedResult); } getMoney () method’s purpose is to provide data for actual test method – shouldAddSameCurrencies () . When we run this test, three tests will be executed running with US Dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs . This can be achieved in 2 annotations as, dataProvider attribute of the @Test annotation informs TestNG asking a method, getMoney () method to provide data Reports TestNG by default produces an HTML report and a TestNG specific XML file and compatible XML files with Ant JUnitReport task. This is handy for integrating into existing build frameworks, but lacks TestNG specific data if any and also possible to produce custom reports by implementing an IReporter reporter class. Tool Support: TestNG is supported, out-of-the-box or via plug-ins, by each of the three major Java IDEs – Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Also, TestNG comes with a custom task for Apache Ant and is supported by the Maven build system. Conclusion: On this entire overview of TestNG, we have discussed some of the important annotations and respective attributes that are frequently used by testers. However, there are more annotations that are used sometimes when working with groups in the project test script. It is always advisable not to do project in test method, since it is used to write the core business logic to be tested. And finally make sure that, the system is equipped with Java 1.5 versions or higher to run the annotations.

It’s important for your mobile and web apps to have an appealing and Eye-catching design that grabs attention and eliminates the blindspots. The ultimate question is, what matters the most while designing UI/UX for a mobile or web application? Some key points such as, User Insights, Values, placements, Clean & Simple, Pain Points, brand integration, following the latest trends, to ensure user attention. These are a few aspects that play a significant role in achieving more user attention. Add Minimal Functions Web or mobile apps are designed to serve simple tasks adding multiple actions could distract the users from reaching their goal. As per the reports, only 46 percent of users find these tactics to be helpful, with 52 percent stating that they’re “annoying & distracting.” Functional Minimalism technique could be a surprisingly better principle that will help to create interactive and intent-focused mobile applications. Functional Minimalism applies to every demanding application, which includes contents, number of actions, and design elements. Unlike mobile apps, a website can accommodate a lot of space for content and attention-grabbing design plus features. Understanding the user’s behaviour and sculpting limited content will help you hold the user’s attention. What We Mean: • Adequate Cognitive Load • Minimum Action Buttons • Logical Actions and Transitions • Simple Actions • Simple Design Order, Consistency, Predictability Order is essential in the process of creating any web or mobile application. An organized visual provides all the necessary things for the user on the screen. The structured hierarchy of contents is a logical sequence of transitioning from the entry point to the app’s main goal. Designing an interactive interface is one of the most effective calls for designers to think about and guide users about what they need to do. This allows users to navigate towards the goal in a simple and easy way with no distractions. Make sure the navigation elements are visible and should be consistent and understandable. Navigation allows users to find their way between screens with absolute intent. Beginner tour is recommended to get the user familiar with UI/UX of Application. Ways of Holding the Phone A designer must understand users’ interaction with their mobile devices. Based on the intent of the application, user interaction and usage might vary. It’s mandatory to determine the best ways to use apps for any specific task and the way people hold their phones in different directions depending on the situation. One-handed, using one thumb; two-handed, using one thumb; and two-handed, using two thumbs are three main ways of using mobile devices. Everything Should be close & Reachable! The main actions icons or buttons must be allocated in prominent positions which draw the users’ attention to any icon or button. Menu options should be large enough to be easily selectable. Too large and too small elements can’t help improve user interaction/experience. Our Ending Note ScriptBees has an exceptional portfolio in building mobile and web applications. We help companies with technology services such as Web & Mobile App Development, Infrastructure Automation, Test Automation, and DevOps. We provide accurate day-1 advantage enabling the best possible solutions. Sharing is caring!

IaC is necessary for regular DevOps practices and used in conjunction with Continuous Delivery. IaC allows DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early on in the development cycle. The developers, and system administrators as well, interact with infrastructure methodically, and at a scale, rather than manually setting up and configuring resources with cloud’s API model help. Engineers can, therefore, interface with infrastructure with code-based tools to help and treat both infrastructure and application code similarly. Infrastructure and servers can now be deployed swiftly with standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches/versions, or duplicated in repeatable ways. Infrastructure Modules Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables users to provide an isolated sector of a public cloud network, thereby creating a private virtual network over which they have complete control. Users will have complete control over private IP addresses, creating subnets, in addition to configuring route tables and network gateways. Other benefits include Disaster Recovery, Multiple Connectivity Options, Secured Features, Extend their Datacenter to Cloud, Network Topologies, and Hybrid Applications among others. Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications easily, using Kubernetes on AWS. Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure across multiple AWS availability zones to eliminate a single point of failure. Benefits include Zero-Downtime, Rolling Deployment, IAM to RBAC mapping, Auto Scaling, IAM roles for Pods, Deploying Helm securely with automated TLS certificate management, and Heterogeneous Worker Groups. Auto Scaling Users can automatically adjust the capacity of the number of compute resources allocated to their applications and maintain steady, predictable performance, depending on the requirements. Advantages include the seamless availability of new instances during demand spikes and automatic decrease during demand drops. Security Users can include a collection of security best practices for managing secrets, credentials, and servers. Includes streamlined support for CloudTrail, KMS, SSH key management via IAM, IAM Groups, fail2ban, NTP, and OS hardening. Distributed Cache A data cache can be configured to span multiple servers, storing common requests and enabling quick retrieval. Amazon ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores. Build data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. MongoDB Cluster Users can deploy a MongoDB cluster, including replica sets, sharding, an automated bootstrapping process, backup, recovery, and OS optimizations. Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana This module includes support to deploy separate Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana clusters, each with automated zero-downtime rolling deployment, automatic recovery of failed servers, and security groups and IAM policy configuration. It also contains scripts for setting up Filebeat and CollectD on an application server to ship off logs and machine metrics to Elasticsearch. OpenVPN Server Users can deploy an OpenVPN server and manage user accounts using Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups. Includes automatic install and configuration of a high-availability OpenVPN server, public key infrastructure (PKI), data backup, IAM policies, security groups, and cross-platform apps to automatically request and revoke credentials. TICK Stack TICK Stack is based on the push model of collecting data. A set of open source components – Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor – collectively deliver a platform to store, capture, monitor and visualize data. Telegraf, a plugin-driven server agent, is used to collect and report metrics. InfluxDB is a high-performance time-series database in order to manage high write and query loads. Chronograph, the user interface and visualization engine of the platform allows for easy monitoring and alerting of the infrastructure. Kapacitor, a data processing engine, can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB. DC/OS Stacks DC/OS (the Distributed Cloud Operating System) is an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other. Amazon ECS Docker Cluster Amazon Elastic Container Service allows users to run Docker applications on a scalable cluster. This eliminates the need for users to install and operate your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or schedule containers on those virtual machines. Value Proposition From the initial development step, we adopt automation in the infrastructure. We allow you to submit the deliveries with greater consistency, eliminating Human error, and supporting task repeatability. Building a secure infrastructure with snowflake configurations comprising the metal servers will avoid the effect in hardware or software requirements, case-by-case manual handling. Automation dramatically replaces the manual efforts, reduces the time taken to deploy thousands of servers, eliminating the snowflakes and configuration, and drift errors. Why Us We provide test-free deliveries for clients that remain unchanged for the majority of the OS flavors. We also offer end-to-end support for the applications that we develop. Apart from this, we provide testing in the cloud environment with the entire modules that can develop in it. Day 1 Advantage As we have the expertise level in providing viable Products / Applications, we can hand over the earlier draft with required functionalities. A well-defined and enriched Application will be offered to the client satisfying their requirements. Process Requirement Analysis – On the requirements that you provide, we analyze and help on how the application is to built. Resource Allocation – A dedicated resource is allocated to the entire Project until the development comes to an end by providing support in between. Involving the Customer – While developing the application, necessary changes/updates are taken from the client and implemented at the initial stage. Product-based outcomes – Once we are done with the finally tested and approved product, it will be delivered straight away to the client. End-to-End Support – After the product is delivered, we are here to support any issues raised at any time.

We make the work easier, combining Kubernetes with various cloud technologies and provide a readily available cloud-native environment to the client. Value Proposition As we are aware of that, Kubernetes is the worthwhile technology that major IT companies are dealing with. In addition to that, you can also gain a few more benefits, even if you have migrated to Kubernetes. Heading towards scalability – Keeping the alternation complexities aside that few organizations are facing, Kubernetes helps you out on changing the development process even at the final development stages. Less-time utilization – When there exist the necessary changes, less time is required to perform those since the entire infrastructure is on the cloud, and it is easy to incorporate the changes. Minimum viable product – Concerning the accuracy, the developed application will satisfy the quality constraint by meeting the minimum requirements that require only a few changes if they are to perform while the development is undergoing. Making as cost-effective – Since the resources used for development are under a cloud, you are nowhere locked while thinking of migrating the entire application to another cloud provider with spending minimal charge. Value Proposition of using Open-Source Container Orchestration System Ease your transition of moving from on-premise to cloud Since we provide a readily available cloud environment for all technologies, we can offer the early draft with the Kubernetes functionality included. Why Us ScriptBees provides the Kubernetes Environment suitable for different cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, and much more. We are here to work with you by assigning a dedicated and expertise Kubernetes team and supporting you during the entire project course. We also offer service consulting that solves your difficulties. Users can follow a one-step mechanism by pushing the whole file into their cloud. This makes it easy for you to scale up during peak demand and scale down on quieter periods. Even we gear up to provide services like – Adding the required nodes for existing projects instead of developing initially, depending on the criteria at that time, and we can pull back the existing file from the cloud pushed earlier. Day 1 Advantage With the available on-premise drafts, you can get an idea of different elements, including development time, change/gathering of requirements. It helps you to get a clear picture of how we are capable of developing the application satisfying your needs. Process • Convert requirements to the development of an end-to-end product • On-time delivery of minimum viable product • Sort out all app dependencies that may exist and make the product viable • Provide a draft at an early/initial stage showcasing how the functionalities would work available in a readily-available environment for variable clouds like AWS, Azure, GCP, and more. • Deliver the application that is easily alterable from one to any other cloud by replacing the Kubernetes with containers if needed. • Offer future support like the addition of nodes to the existing projects/applications to develop new modules along with it instead of expanding the same project from the initial stage. DevOps Our DevOps practices allow software development and IT teams to work in parallel with each other. The teams simultaneously build, test and release software sooner while maintaining timelines. The firm handshake between these teams leads to better collaboration, a shift in mindset and tighter integration. Benefits include managing unplanned work in a better manner, faster innovation, ability to solve critical issues quickly, and delivering higher value to businesses and customers. Why Us Our DevOps pipeline is built on Docker Containers using next-generation technologies, especially on the cloud-native side. Everything we’ve done can be run on the cloud or on-premises in a highly virtualized manner. The pipeline that we have developed will help end-users accelerate their SDLC, thereby providing them agility in terms of how they deliver projects into production in a much faster manner. We can provide cloud-native services that go beyond AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. Having already implemented the above practices, we will be able to cater to any requirement that the client has, regardless of the modules. We set up all the tools that are required to implement the DevOps process at the client location. Once done, we stay on until we ensure that the stakeholders at the client location are completely trained. DevOps Toolset We leverage modern technologies that include a combination of effective tools and processes to allow teams to innovate rapidly and at the same time, reliably for clients. The DevOps toolset includes a combination of JIRA to capture agile process-based Epics and Stories; GIT for Versioning; Jenkins / CloudBees Automation Server / Pipeline Management; Artifactory / Nexus for Artifact Management; Terraforms / Chef / Ansible to develop scriptable architectures & manage Infrastructure as code; and, Kubernetes clusters for microservices deployments Our DevOps Practices Our CI/CD pipeline is built in a cloud-native fashion. Our practices involve morning to evening scrum calls, two- to four-week sprints (this depends on the scope of the project in hand). The first three or four sprints generally streamline the development cycle, resulting in a steady output and performance. • Continuous Integration (CI) : Developers integrate the code into a shared repository multiple times each day. Teams will be able to spot challenges early on with the help of an automated build that verifies each check-in. Frequent integration also enables the teams to locate errors quite easily; deliver software more swiftly; and, cater lesser time to debugging & more time to adding new features. There is also a considerably less back-tracking and this results in a lower cost of execution. Without CI, detecting problems and fixing them at the right time is less likely due to longer periods between integrations. This can lead to a project failing altogether. • Continuous Testing : This process enables the testing to be merged with the development process and not pushed towards the end of the process. This is predominantly for the team to evaluate immediately if the release candidate is eligible to go through the delivery pipeline. Benefits include evaluating business risks, executing tests that are ideal at every stage of the continuous delivery pipeline, giving actionable feedback and run end-to-end tests that evaluate the end-user experience across all technologies, both front-end, and back-end. • Continuous Delivery (CD) : Continuous Delivery allows large organizations to operate in a lean, agile manner and be as pioneering as start-ups. The Testing, Support, Development, and Operations teams come together as a single delivery unit in order to automate & restructure the build-test-release process to have a low risk. Code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. Developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process if continuous delivery is implemented effectively. • Continuous deployment (CD) : Continuous Deployment is generally considered to be a part of the Continuous Integration workflow itself. As part of the software release strategy, any code commit that goes through during the automated testing phase is subsequently moved into live production. Therefore, there is no time lag between code change -> platform testing -> live production, in Continuous Deployment. This cycle continues for all phases of the release. • Containerize applications : Authoring immutable infrastructure can take some time, and time is money. Teams will appreciate that application containerization is automated in Jenkins for applications that generate images. The Dockerfile is auto-generated. Monitoring and Logging Organizations monitor metrics and logs to see how application and infrastructure performance impacts the experience of their product’s end-user. By capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users, shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes. Active monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and as application and infrastructure update frequency increases. Creating alerts or performing real-time analysis of this data also helps organizations more proactively monitor their services. Communication and Collaboration Increased communication and collaboration in an organization are one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps. The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations. Building on top of that, these teams set strong cultural norms around information sharing and facilitating communication through the use of chat applications, issue or project tracking systems, and wikis. This helps speed up communication across developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing or sales, allowing all parts of the organization to align more closely on goals and projects. Cloud Services ScriptBees enables your teams with cloud adoption and provides cutting-edge cloud capabilities in SaaS, PaaS & Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Our experts can help you create value and consequently increase revenues with the help of all the cloud capabilities. We implement practices that are cost-effective, simple and agile. If you intend on cutting down infrastructure costs, and at the same time, maintain high levels of operational functionality with your infrastructure, processes, and applications, then don’t look beyond the cloud. Our Cloud First, Business Driven mantra enables you to extend collaboration and information access to customers, partners and employees anywhere, anytime, from any device. Value to Clients • Optimized Cloud Adoption • Reduced Cost • Faster Time-to-Market • Avoid the hassles of IT concerns • Zero up-front hardware expenditure • Leverage virtual data warehousing Cloud Development & Testing The cloud is predominantly selected for test and development projects to ensure cost optimization for your company, allowing developers to be more independent and productive. This will result in improved efficiencies and cost savings throughout the organization. We consider this to be a cost-effective practice as well as quick, convenient & efficient. Needless to say, we ensure that the cloud solutions used (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.) are the most secure. Our cloud developers can provide assistance in selecting the best service for your company. However, the benefits of using the cloud for test and development purposes stretch beyond the developers and IT team. A common concern from IT Ops previously was about the delay in setting up and tearing down test environments for developers. Now, developers can be up and running on a PaaS or IaaS cloud within a very short amount of time, and pay only when there is a requirement. The team can develop technologies directly in the cloud with global access, with the assistance of hardware that is located, stored, and maintained in a single location. The whole of the IT team can place calls, conduct training, demos and run software tests in a single environment via cloud development & testing. The team can now place its complete attention on developing the IT business strategy now that hardware management is no longer a priority. Launching a test and development lab in the cloud also enables organizations to test the waters. IT managers now have the opportunity to select applications to launch in the cloud and monitor performance and usage spikes accordingly. Additionally, administrators can conduct tests on new software and development iterations with the option to rollback to previous versions as required. Cloud Migrations When planning for a migration to the cloud, it is important for enterprises to decide whether public, private or hybrid cloud approach is well suited, not to mention, how the applications and environments are migrated to the cloud and in which order. The primary benefit of a cloud migration involves hosting applications and data in a suitable IT environment, while calculating costs, evaluating performance, taking the required security measures and also implementing organizational changes as required. We provide end-to-end migration services regardless of how critical your business case is. Be assured that you have access to our expertise before, during and after your cloud migration. Our team of cloud experts provides support in defining your cloud roadmap, planning and executing your migration to the cloud, and also work with you to avail your new cloud-based solutions. 24/7 Cloud Monitoring & Support/Managed Services While Managed services optimize recurring in-house IT costs, automate business processes, transform IT systems, and allow you to achieve your business objectives, our dedicated 24/7 support team monitors your complete cloud stack of applications/servers and works with you to apply required upgrades and patches while ensuring that there is zero downtime. We also recommend continuous service improvements giving our customers the bandwidth to focus on their cloud transformation strategies.

RPA is an automation technology that enables companies to avoid redundant tasks in a digital environment. RPA involves bots, software programs that can mimic various assignments performed by any human employee. Assignments such as data entry in CRM systems, automated invoicing, text recognition, and more. The key elements of RPA can be found in the abbreviation. R — Robotic Robotics defines the special algorithm or a software bot that can execute any task. Similar to industrial robots, RPA bots follow predetermined rules to emulate user interactions. For example, distributing incoming support tickets between the support team. P — Process Process defines the sequence of steps for any task to be accomplished. For example, a support manager needs to handle different types of incoming inquiries and respond to them based on their request. Providing the same information for common inquiries requires extra resources and attention to ensure successful customers. RPA bot can replace the extra resource and performs the above sequence just like a real person. A — Automation Automation can reduce human participation and perform the tasks as mentioned in the sequence. RPA can reduce human resource participation and can work, manage an enormous amount of data at lightning-fast speeds 24/7. RPA is a powerful technology that can assist human resources, enhance the customer experience, and boost digital transformation. Watch RPA Bots Automating VolunteerMark Where can RPA be used?
